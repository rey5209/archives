            <h1>About this project</h1>
            <p>
        I’m Rey Ramos, a Data Engineer working with OpenAI. 
        <b>I started this project in 2021</b> when a fellow brother hired me. It was an enjoyable journey, but over time, things changed, and I could no longer take full responsibility on my own. 
        I found a friend who, like me, was passionate about website and software development, and together we maintained this project—just the two of us. 
        However, circumstances have changed again, and I’ve decided to either discontinue the project or pass it on to someone willing to take it forward. 
        <b>As the demand for Data Engineering and AI grows, my friend and I are starting our own company to build the future, while I also prepare for a new chapter in life—building my own family soon.</b> 
        <b>Once I begin this new chapter, I will be cutting off and deleting all my social media accounts.</b> 
        All my source files will be archived here for anyone who wishes to explore or continue the work.
