            <article>
      <p class="highlight"><strong>I regret to announce that I will no longer be able to maintain this program and will be stepping down from it.</strong></p>

      <p>This program has been largely used for monitoring across multiple districts. It is powered by AI and a database backend, and it has served its purpose well for the communities depending on it.</p>

      <p>It was created and maintained by just two people, and it has been an enjoyable journey. I am proud of what we built together and grateful for every person who learned from and contributed to the project.</p>

      <p class="small">I believe there are many people who can continue this work; I would be happy to see others take the project forward and keep it alive.</p>

      <h2>Why I'm stepping away</h2>
      <p>Reason: I am focusing now on building my own company, creating a new future, and surrounding myself with friends who support me and my family. That is where my attention will be moving forward.</p>

      <p>To begin this new chapter, I have deleted my old contacts and taken steps to start fresh. It's a difficult but necessary decision—one that feels right for my family and my personal growth.</p>

      <p>Thank you to everyone who supported us on this journey. If you want to continue the project or need any resources or guidance before the handover, please reach out to the community or the remaining contributors.</p>
