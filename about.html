            <p>I’m Rey Ramos, a Data Engineer working with OpenAI, passionate about innovation and the endless possibilities of AI. 
        Right now, I’m busy building my own company, which means I’m no longer actively working on my recent projects. 
        Instead, I’ve decided to pass them on to people who can take them further. All my source files will be archived here, 
        so anyone with the curiosity and drive can discover, learn from, and build upon them.</p>
